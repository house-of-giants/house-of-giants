You’ve probably seen it on our site. Maybe in an email. Maybe we even said it on a call.

**“We’re tech agnostic.”**

Cool. But…what does that _actually_ mean?

## The Short Version: We Don’t Force a Fit

Some web agencies are Shopify-only. Or WordPress-only. Or obsessed with that one JS framework they use on _every single project._

House of Giants isn’t like that. We don’t believe in the one size fits all approach, because the brands we partner with? They’re not one size fits all either.

“Tech agnostic” means **we pick the right tool for your business**, not the one that’s easiest for us.

## The Long Version: Tech Should Serve the Problem, Not Be the Problem

Let’s say you’re running a growing QSR brand. You’ve got multiple locations, and a POS-integrated site builder that’s starting to feel like a straitjacket. It’s slow. Can’t scale. And every time you try to run a promo, it breaks the mobile layout.

A lot of dev shops would push you straight into a tool _they_ know best. Headless CMS, Next.js, some snazzy frontend framework they’ve already got templated out.

But what if that’s not what you need?

Maybe your content team wants easier publishing tools. Maybe your backend ops team needs real time order syncing. Maybe you just need a custom WordPress site with a killer menu and embedded ordering without bloating the stack.

**Being tech agnostic means we listen first, build second.**

We treat your needs like a blueprint, not a compatibility checklist.

##

## What That Looks Like in Practice

It means we’ve built:

- **WordPress sites** that scale for national QSR brands.
- **React-based platforms** for startups juggling real-time data and customer dashboards.
- **Custom ordering flows** that don’t rely on templates or subscriptions.
- **Simple, beautiful CMS interfaces** tailored to actual team workflows.

And we’ve done it all _without locking anyone into systems they didn’t choose._

## The Result? Better Long-Term Value

You get performance, scalability, and usability, without the baggage. No recurring fees for features you don’t use. No re-platforming nightmare two years down the road. Just **clean, custom solutions built to grow with you.**

Because tech should **solve your problem**, not create new ones.

## TL;DR: We Build Around You. Not Around a Platform.

When you work with House of Giants, you don’t get a pre-baked stack.

You get a partner that asks _why_, _how_, and _what’s next_, then builds a solution that fits like a glove.
