Your POS knows how to take an order.

But it doesn’t know how to win a customer.

If you’re relying on [Toast’s website builder](https://pos.toasttab.com/products/websites) or [Square’s online site tools](https://squareup.com/us/en/online-store) to represent your brand online, you’re already behind. These “all-in-one” platforms may seem convenient, but when it comes to actual results? They cost more than you think.

In the quick-service world, every second counts, and your QSR website should reflect that.

## **Why “Free” Site Builders Are Too Expensive**

Here’s the math no one talks about:

- You’re locked into templates that weren’t designed for _your_ service model.
- Your site drags during peak traffic — the exact moment you need it to perform.
- You lose orders from customers who abandon clunky mobile experiences.
- You end up duct-taping together third-party tools just to get basic features.

The result?

Lost revenue.

Missed orders.

A brand that feels generic in a space that demands a little bit of soul.

## **What Restaurant Brands Actually Need**

Modern restaurant web design should do more than look clean, it should convert. Whether you’re running 2 locations or 200, your site needs to:

- Load fast, especially on mobile
- Reflect your unique brand and service style
- Let customers order, book, or browse quickly
- Support multi-location logic (menus, hours, promos, delivery zones)
- Integrate seamlessly with the tools your team already uses

That’s exactly what our custom [QSR website development services](https://houseofgiants.com/restaurant-websites) are built for.

## **A Custom Site Pays for Itself**

We’ve helped brands move from website add-on services provided by outfits like Toast or Square, into scalable, fully integrated web platforms that grow with them. The benefits are real:
