# **White-Labeled Development Pod :: Partnership Overview**

**Provided by House of Giants**

*A scalable, full-service development team delivered as a white-labeled extension of your agency.*

---

## **Purpose of This Engagement**

*This engagement provides your agency with a fully managed, senior-led development team (“Pod”) that operates as an invisible extension of your brand. House of Giants supplies the technical leadership, developers, and QA needed to deliver projects end-to-end—without requiring you to hire or manage a development department.*

## **What Is a White-Labeled Development Pod?**

A House of Giants Pod is a **self-contained, agency-branded development team** built to deliver projects from start to finish. The Pod integrates directly into your workflows and tools, with HoG providing all engineering oversight while your clients see only your agency.

* Technical Director / Pod Lead (HoG senior engineer)  
* Developers (HoG-recruited and managed)  
* QA support (dedicated or shared depending on Pod tier)  
* Optional project management support  
* Your clients never see House of Giants.  
* All work is delivered as your agency.

The Pod integrates into your systems, tools, and processes, with HoG ensuring technical quality and execution.

## **HoG Responsibilities**
