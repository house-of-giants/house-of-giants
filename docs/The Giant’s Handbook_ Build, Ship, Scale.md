**House of Giants — Internal Operating Playbook**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** Nov 18, 2025  
**Owners:** Founders (primary), Delivery Lead, Partnerships/Marketing, Ops/Finance

---

## **0\) One‑Page Executive Summary**

***Who we are*** **::** We build **high‑performance websites and web apps** for **startups/scale‑ups, multi‑location restaurants (QSR), and creative/enterprise teams**. Our stance: **No templates. No bloat. Tech‑agnostic. Results‑first.** 

***What we sell*** **::** Three transparent build tiers: **Baseline Brawler ($15k+)**, **Growth Engine ($25k+)**, **Flagship Flex ($40k+)** with a **flat monthly billing model** until completion. 

**How we win:**

1. **Tech‑agnostic solutioning**—we pick the right stack for the job, not the one we know best. 

2. **Small by design**—principals do the work; fast decisions; direct accountability. 

3. **Colorado roots, national proof**—local insight for Denver/CO brands; portfolio credibility across industries. 

**12‑month “Big Bets.”**

**We’re focusing on three strategic bets that promise the highest return for House of Giants as we shift into the startup/scale-up space.**

#### **1\) MVP to Market Accelerator Package**

**Description:** Launch a streamlined build package tailored for startups: rapid-deployment (8-12 weeks), preset tech stacks (headless CMS \+ Jamstack \+ API integrations), focused on fast time-to-value and scalability.

**Why it matters:** Startups need speed and clarity. This package matches their urgency and budget-profile while leveraging our custom development strength.

**Success Metrics:** Number of startup deals won; average sale cycle length; deal size; margin per deal.

**Owner:** Delivery Lead / Partnerships

**Timeline:** Q1 → Q2 rollout, fully marketed by Q3

**Quick Wins (30-60 days):** Define scope template; build marketing deck; launch pilot offer for first two startup clients.

---

#### **2\) Tech-Stack Enablement & Differentiation (AI \+ Headless \+ Jamstack)**

**Description:** Elevate our internal expertise, tooling, and messaging around advanced stacks (headless CMS, Jamstack, AI-augmented workflows). Create a “HoG Starter Kit” and build signature case stories.

**Why it matters:** Startups and scale-ups demand future-proof, high-performance platforms — making this a clear differentiator for us.

**Success Metrics:** Internal build time reduction; margin improvement; number of deals citing this stack; performance benchmark stats (LCP, INP, CLS).

**Owner:** Tech Lead

**Timeline:** Q2 build kit; Q3 begin client rollout; Q4 public launch.

**Quick Wins:** Document preferred stack options; train team on headless/Jamstack; pick one live client as “stack pilot”.

---

#### **3\) Startup Ecosystem Partnerships & Referral Engine**

**Description:** Build and activate an ecosystem of startup-facing partners (accelerators, VC firms, incubators, service providers) to generate referral leads and co-marketing opportunities.

**Why it matters:** To shift from QSR to startup/scale-up ICP, we need high-intent inbound leads, and partnerships unlock credible channels.

**Success Metrics:** Number of partner agreements signed; leads generated via partner channels; conversion rate from partner leads; cost per lead.

**Owner:** Partnerships/Marketing

**Timeline:** Q1 identify top 10 partners; Q2 establish co-marketing programs; Q3 scale across national network.

**Quick Wins:** Create partner deck \+ offer; host a “Founders Workshop” event; map local Denver/Colorado ecosystem then expand nationally.

| \# | Focus | Owner | Key Metric | Timeline |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | MVP Accelerator | Delivery Lead / Partnerships | \# of startup deals & sales cycle length | Q1–Q3 |
| 2 | Tech-Stack Enablement | Tech Lead | Build time reduction & stack-cited deals | Q2–Q4 |
| 3 | Ecosystem Partnerships | Partnerships/Marketing | Partner-sourced leads & conversion rate | Q1–Q3 |

## **1\) Tenets & Differentiators**

* **No templates → No mercy.** Custom code and UX strategy that scales. 

* **Tech‑agnostic.** We don’t force WordPress, Shopify, or a single JS framework; we pick what actually fits. 

* **Small on purpose.** The people you meet are the people who build; we keep quality and speed. 

* **Outcomes \> artifacts.** “Not just pretty pixels”—we ship measurable impact. 

* **Transparent pricing.** Packages \+ flat monthly billing. No black‑box games. 

**We will not:**

* Take work below our price floor

* Ship inaccessible, slow, or fragile sites

* “Yes‑man” band‑aids that hide root problems.

## **2\) Market Map, ICPs & Anti‑Personas**

### **A. Market Segments & Buyer Roles**

HoG operates across three core market segments where our custom, performance-first approach delivers maximum value.

| Market Segment | Primary Need / Core Pain | Budget Floor Signal (Min) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Startups / Scale-ups** | Need custom web/apps for MVPs or V1 launches; must prove traction for investors/customers. | App Phase ≥ **$60k**. |
| **Restaurants & QSR** | Need scalable, multi-location sites and custom direct ordering systems to reduce third-party fees and fix weak POS provider tools. | Marketing Site ≥ **$15k** (preferably ≥ $20k$). |
| **Enterprise / Marketing Teams** | Need high-performance corporate sites, complex integrations, and a strategic partner to fix brittle themes/plugin sprawl. | Marketing Site ≥ **$15k** (preferably ≥ $20k$). |

**Primary Buyer Roles:** Founder/CEO, Marketing Lead, Product Lead, and Ops/IT.

**Core Pains Driving Inbound:** Slow legacy sites, brittle themes, plugin sprawl, weak mobile, POS/order UX gaps, and limited internal editing experiences.

### **B. Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): Triggers, Pains, and Mental State**

We seek three primary profiles, identified by their emotional state and specific trigger events.

#### **1\. The Overwhelmed Startup Founder**

| Attribute | Detail from Sources |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Mental State** | **Exhausted, skeptical, and low on trust**. |
| **Core Pain** | They are searching because they’ve **hit a wall**. They suffer from **fragile codebases, missed deadlines** from prior vendors, stack paralysis, and security/compliance asks (like SSO or audit trails) blocking deals. |
| **Action Trigger** | **LOIs or pilot interest contingent on a working demo**, an upcoming funding raise with a product milestone attached, or their CTO bandwidth is maxed. Their friend’s last rec failed, so they need custom help **now**. |
| **Decision Criteria** | Proof of intelligence, not polish. They prioritize a **senior team** doing the work, **speed to demo** with a scalable foundation, and transparent pricing. |
| **HoG GTM Alignment** | MVP to Market Accelerator Package (8–12 weeks). |

#### **2\. The QSR Marketing Lead**

| Attribute | Detail from Sources |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Mental State** | **Embarrassed, under scrutiny,** and worried about budget perception. |
| **Core Pain** | Their CMO is asking why online orders dropped. Their POS provider (Toast, Square) promised a "free website builder," but it is **cookie-cutter, slow, and not mobile-first**. |
| **Action Trigger** | A **franchisee complained** customers couldn’t find the menu online. They need to show their boss they found someone who “gets us”. |
| **Real Search Prompt** | *"custom restaurant website for toast POS"* or *"mobile restaurant site fast"*. |
| **HoG GTM Alignment** | QSR direct-order campaign emphasizing third-party fee savings. |

#### **3\. The Brand Manager / Creative Director**

| Attribute | Detail from Sources |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Mental State** | **Curious, strategic, and hopeful**, but wary of devs who “just want a ticket list”. |
| **Core Pain** | They have **outgrown their current site** and don’t want to redo it every year; the product is solid but the site is clunky. |
| **Action Trigger** | Stakeholders are asking **“what’s next?”** and they want to show proactive ownership. |
| **Need** | They seek a partner who **thinks like a strategist** and can execute a **website redesign for scaling brands**. |

### **C. Anti-Personas and Qualification Filters**

Anti-Personas define clients who are a bad fit, waste sales effort, or conflict with HoG’s tenets.

**Non-Negotiable Filters (Must meet budget and intent criteria):**

| Filter Category | Anti-Persona Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Budget Floor** | Clients seeking custom development for a **Marketing site below $15k** (preferably below $20k) or an **App phase below $60k**. This includes clients whose ideal solution involves DIY platforms under the budget floor. |
| **Timeline Realism** | Leads demanding compressed timelines that compromise quality, often saying they **“need it next week”**. (HoG targets: Marketing sites **\<45 days**; App phases **\<90 days**). |
| **Lead Quality** | **Cold referrals with no meeting booked**, **unsponsored RFPs**, and those who are **“just shopping” with no timeline**. |
| **Tenet Conflict** | Clients demanding **“Yes-man” band-aids that hide root problems** or those who accept inaccessible, slow, or fragile sites. Clients presenting **hard security blockers** we cannot meet are also excluded. |

**Qualification Score (yes/no, 1–5):** Budget fit • Timeline realism • Complexity we love • Internal champion • Post-launch plan.

### **D. Alignment to Internal Tenets**

The rejection of Anti-Personas directly supports our operational tenets:

* **No templates → No mercy:** The custom nature of our work necessitates the budget floors defined for ICPs.

* **We will not take work below our price floor**.

* **We will not ship inaccessible, slow, or fragile sites** (enforcing performance budgets like LCP ≤ 2.5s and WCAG 2.2 AA baseline).
